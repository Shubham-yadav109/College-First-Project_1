      <p>
      Essentially, raised bed gardening involves growing vegetables, herbs, or fruits in soil that is enclosed and elevated above ground level. The enclosure or frame is generally made of wood, stone, or metal. 

When adding raised beds in gardens, one of the best things is that you have complete control over the soil quality. This soil thus ensures better nutrients, aeration, drainage, and a controlled growing environment.   

Apart from soil quality control, there are also several other benefits of growing plants in raised garden beds that leave you wanting more. Here are a few!

        <img src="/BlogImg/GB/KG_6.webp" alt="Transplanting" className="kg-big-image" />
        <p className="kg-description">In-ground gardening is not necessarily the easiest thing because it involves a lot of bending, sitting down on the ground, and kneeling over things to sow things, prune, and do overall maintenance. 

However, when you choose to have raised beds in garden spaces, you can customize the height according to your preference and convenience. This also makes gardening easier and more accessible to senior citizens & physically disabled. </p>
